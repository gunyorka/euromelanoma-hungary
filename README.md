### `data/`
- Raw data files from the Hungarian Euromelanoma screening questionnaires.  
- These files are provided as originally collected, without preprocessing.  

### `common_objects/`
- Preprocessed and filtered data saved as `.rds` objects.  
- These objects serve as the input for analyses in `script/`.
